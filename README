This project contains the open-source artifacts of the research paper **"On the (In)Security of Non-resettable Device Identifiers in Custom Android Systems"**. 
The study investigates covert channels introduced by system customizations, which could be used to obtain non-resettable device identifiers in custom Android systems.

## Project Structure

The tool used in the paper is located in the sub-projects of this repository.

## Ethical Considerations
Since our findings are based on a large-scale analysis of custom ROMs from various global vendors, publicly sharing these results could lead to privacy risks. 
As a result, we have chosen not to disclose the specific details of our findings in this repository.
